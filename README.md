This is a little stupid pathtracer made as a study of GO language... and pathtracing...

**This code by no means should be treated as guide or studying material!** this is literally my first GO program

implemented lambert and Microfacet model with GGX and Beckman distributions, the source paper is [here](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~srm/publications/EGSR07-btdf.pdf), though it is a complicated reading material for someone who has no experience with bsdfs, rendering etc, also there IS at least one error in those formulas for sure (guess where), and author skips a bunch of steps that would help a novice greately to understand the material.
